# React and Forms

## react forms

- In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself. To write an uncontrolled component, instead of writing an event handler for every state update, you can use a ref to get form values from the DOM.

- the data should be updated instantly so it could render the input values

- by using the property 'target'

## the ternary operator
- 
The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement. When condition evaluates to true, the operator returns “This is True”; otherwise (when condition is falsy) it returns “This is False”.

- ``` console.log(x===y? true : false) ```
