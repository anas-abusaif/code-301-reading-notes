# Putting it all together

1. How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?
- by drawing boxis around every component and naming them

2. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
- a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

3. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
- it means building a website with no interactivity

4. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
- To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with state.

5. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
