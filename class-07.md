### 1. Who is Roy Fielding?
He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

### 2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
 Because they weren't designed to be used like that.

 ### 3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
 HTTP gives users a way to interact with web resources such as HTML files by transmitting hypertext messages between clients and servers. HTTP clients generally use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections to communicate with servers.

   ### 7. What does PATCH do?
