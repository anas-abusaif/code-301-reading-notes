# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

## 1.What is functional programming?
 a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

 ## 2.What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
 * It returns the same result if given the same arguments
 * It does not cause any observable side effects
 
 ## 3.What are the benefits of a pure function?
 The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. 

 ## 4.What is immutability?
 Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

 ## 5.What is Referential transparency?
 if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
