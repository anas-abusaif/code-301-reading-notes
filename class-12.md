## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
complex query intensive environment

## Give a real world example.
MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
hierarchical data storage

## Give a real world example.
MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
noSQL

## Which type of database is best for scalability?
SQL

## What does SQL stand for?
structured query language

## What is a realational database?
A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
 a collection of tables

 ## What is a ‘schema’?
 the logical configuration of all or part of a relational database.

 ## What is a NoSQL database?
 a type of database that stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first

 ## Howo does it work?
 NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables.

 ## What is inside of a Mongo database?
 MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections

 ## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
 While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions

 ## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
 oSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have
