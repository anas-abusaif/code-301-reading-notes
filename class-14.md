# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?

These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. You could play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.

## When are diversity efforts most successful?

when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders.

## Why do diverse companies perform better?

companies with diverse talent and executives are more likely to retain the best talent and engage in decision-making that accounts for orienting to larger varieties of customers than companies with a more monolithic customer base.

## Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
